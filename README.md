CMI is based on PECS (Image Exchange Based Communication System). Therefore, it allows the infant to develop communication based on six levels, one of the biggest feature in CMI is that from the two years of investigation, we decide to provide just a single Screen which can be used for the six levels, this feature add simplicity which is one of the targets that CMI provides. In addition, it allows adding and editing, adding, selecting and deleting  images to enrich the context of its use.

On the other hand, it can also be used by people who do not have an ASD but have difficulties to communicate. Also, you can check this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFqzmWQx_yg&t=7s) in Youtube that explain how it works and how you can use it.
